📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, a powerful architecture for building intelligent applications that combine knowledge retrieval with large language models (LLMs).

Here’s the workflow:

📂 Document Loading → Import any text/PDF file.

✂️ Text Splitting → Break large content into smaller, manageable chunks.

🔎 Embeddings → Convert text chunks into high-dimensional vector representations.

🗄️ Vector Database (Pinecone) → Store embeddings for fast semantic search.

🤖 LLM Integration (Google/OpenAI) → Retrieve the most relevant chunks and generate accurate, context-aware answers to user queries.

For demonstration purposes, I uploaded my resume. The system can now answer questions such as:

“Which LangChain project has he worked on?”

“What technical skills are mentioned?”

“Summarize the professional experience in one paragraph.”

Although I used my resume as input, this architecture is not limited to resumes. You can plug in any document or dataset and build a wide variety of intelligent systems.

🌍 Potential Applications

This same pipeline can be extended to:

Q&A Bot for PDFs – Upload research papers, contracts, or reports and ask natural-language questions about them.

Knowledge Base Assistant – Connect it to company policies, product manuals, or customer support docs for instant answers.

Personal Research Assistant – Feed in multiple articles or academic papers and ask for comparisons or summaries.

Legal Document Analyzer – Quickly query terms, clauses, or obligations in lengthy legal agreements.

E-Learning Tutor – Upload textbooks/course notes and let students interact with them via questions.

Medical Record Assistant – Retrieve patient history or summarize clinical notes (with proper compliance).

Financial Report Summarizer – Query balance sheets, quarterly reports, or investment docs.

Multi-Document Chatbot – Combine multiple files into one knowledge base for more complex Q&A.
